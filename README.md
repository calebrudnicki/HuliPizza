# HuliPizza
A basic pizza ordering app built in SwiftUI

## Features

- Presents the user with an array of pizzas to order
- Allows the user to pick a pizza type, size, and quantity and add it to their order 
- Keeps a running total of the entire order
- Shows a history view of the types of pizzas ordered

## Development

I created this SwiftUI app following this video tutorial: [SwiftUI Essential Training](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/swiftui-essential-training/the-mind-blowing-game-changer-swiftui?u=2130809). This tutorial worked with the following concepts and how they fit into SwiftUI:
- ContentView previews
- HStacks, VStacks, and ZStacks
- Lists and Loops
- Modifiers
- State variables
- Identifiable protocols
- Tab bars
- Alerts
- Style sheet
- Pickers
- Steppers
- Text input
- Animation
- Tap gestures
- MapKit
- Embedding SwiftUI into UIKit and UIKit into SwiftUI
